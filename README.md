_MineSweepear Island_ is a Minesweeper-inspired puzzle game developed for **Ludum Dare 32**, where the theme was "An Unconventional Weapon." Set on a hexagonal grid, players must create sweep paths to score points while avoiding hidden mines. Each tile displays the number of adjacent mines and its point value, adding a strategic layer to path creation. The unique twist comes from the game's use of spatialized audio cuesâ€”players use their ears to detect nearby mines, introducing an innovative audio-based gameplay mechanic. 


## Folder architecture.
Public contains every ressources needed by the webpages such as img, css, js. Currently contains basic cover css from bootstrap, the philoGL lib, a bufferLoader lib for importing sounds and a spatialHash lib that I often use.

views contains the ejs necessary to produce the webpage.

res are some code base I use to remember how to set up philoGL and WebAudio, some examples shaders and the frequency of all the musical notes (e.g A = 440Hz)
